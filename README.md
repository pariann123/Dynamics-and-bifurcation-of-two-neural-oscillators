# Dynamics-and-bifurcation-of-two-neural-oscillators
Analysis of dynamics and bifurcations between two coupled neural oscillators.

Processing of sensory information is connected to the oscillatory activity of neurons (Kelso et al., 1986; Miller, 1991). The Wilson-Cowan model (1972) suggests that oscillations arise as a result of interactions between populations of neurons. The aim here is to model two Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), which represent two different neural populations, to understand how the type and strength of the connections affect the dynamics and bifurication of the neural network.

This code produces phase-plot diagrams, and time-solutions and steady states of the two coupled ODEs which give us insight about their dynamics and bifurications.
